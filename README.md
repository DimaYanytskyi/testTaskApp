# Records Viewer App

This project consists of two parts:
1. **Backend (FastAPI + SQLite + Docker Compose)**
2. **Android Client (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + Clean Architecture + Hilt + Retrofit)**

The backend provides a REST API with records of three possible types:
- **text** ‚Äî displays text on screen
- **image** ‚Äî displays an image
- **webview** ‚Äî opens a web page

The Android app automatically fetches a random record and displays it based on its type.

---

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Backend Server
Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.

From the root of the backend project (where `docker-compose.yml` is located), run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This command will:
- Build the Docker image
- Run the FastAPI server on port **8000**
- Automatically **seed the SQLite database with random records** during build

You can verify the backend is working by opening in your browser:
- [http://localhost:8000/records](http://localhost:8000/records)
- [http://localhost:8000/record/1](http://localhost:8000/record/1)

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Android App

1. Open the **Android project** (folder `testTaskApp` or `RecordsClient`) in **Android Studio**.
2. Make sure the server is running (`docker compose up`).
3. Press **Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è** to launch the app on an **emulator**.

---

## üß© How It Works

- When the app starts, it requests `/records` from the server and receives a list of record IDs.
- It then selects a **random ID** from that list and requests `/record/{id}`.
- Depending on the record‚Äôs type:
  - `text` ‚Üí Displays a text screen
  - `image` ‚Üí Displays an image screen
  - `webview` ‚Üí Opens a WebView screen

## ‚öôÔ∏è Notes

- If testing on a **real device**, replace `10.0.2.2` with your computer‚Äôs local IP (e.g. `192.168.x.x`).
